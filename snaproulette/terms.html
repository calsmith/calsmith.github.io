	<h1>Privacy and Terms of Use</h1>
	<p>Snaproulette is all about meeting people and having great conversations. As you use Snaproulette, here are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
	
	<h2>General Tips</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>While anonymity can be fun, it can sometimes bring out a negative side of people. If you’re not enjoying yourself, simply leave the chat and wait to be matched with someone else! Snaproulette cannot be held responsible for the content of messages sent on the service nor can we filter everything uploaded to our servers.</li>
		<li>Do not use Snaproulette if you are a minor. Check with the laws in your country to ensure you are old enough to signup.</li>
		<li>Not everyone on the internet is who they seem. Please employ common sense and never meet with strangers.</li>
		<li>If you would like to report something, please use the ‘Feedback’ button in the app.</li>
	</ul>
